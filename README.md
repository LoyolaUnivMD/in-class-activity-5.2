# In Class Activity 5.2 - Sorting

I want you to implement a basic sorting algorithm in Java. The goal is to reinforce your understanding of sorting concepts and provide hands-on experience with a straightforward algorithm.

### Part 1: Sorting class
Define a Java class called Sorting with the following method:

    public static void bubbleSort(int[] array): 
    // Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

### Part 2: Main class (e.g., SortingDemo)
Create a Java class that contains the main method. In the main method:

    // Instantiate an array of integers with a reasonable size (e.g., 8 elements) 
    // Initialize it with random values.

    // Display the initial state of the array.

    // Call the bubbleSort method from the Sorting class to sort the array in ascending order.

    // Display the sorted array AT EACH STEP OF THE SORT.

### Instructions:

 - Write the code for the Sorting class with the specified method for Bubble Sort.
    
 - Create a main class (e.g., SortingDemo) with the main method to demonstrate the functionality of the sorting algorithm.
 - Remember to display the array at each step of the sort.
 - Provide comments in your code to explain the logic and functionality.
 - Test your program with different input scenarios to ensure its correctness.
