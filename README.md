# In Class Activity 5.1
Due: Thursday Feb 15, 2024

## Problem: 
You need to refactor the ATM application from the last lab (Lab 3) so that it has proper error checking, objects, and methods.

## Purpose: 
This activity gives you practice with:
* Designing and programming functions
* Re-using many of the other aspects of Java we've learned so far
* Testing code
* Using loops for error checking
* Using classes and methods for refactoring code

## Details:
You need to refactor some code from Lab 3 so that the following is true:
* It is now organized using a class, objects, and methods.
* If the user enters an invalid option they are prompted again, and this continues until they give a valid option
* If the user enters a negative number to deposit or withdraw, they are asked again, and this continues until they give a valid value.
* If their balance becomes negative, alert the user it is negative and will be charged 5%.

## Steps:
We are going to practice _**"iterative development"**_: focusing on one aspect of the problem first, then once that works, focusing on the rest of it.

1. Understand the problem
2. Look over the Lab3 code.
3. Determine the methods that might make sense in the code. Take at most 20 minutes planning. Refer to your class notes to help you plan!
4. Re-arrange the code into objects and methods without adding the new error checking. Refer to your notes to help you code!
5. Test that your code still works using the test cases you developed for Lab 3.

6. Design your error checking functions. Put these designs in algorithm.txt. Look back at your notes to help you do this!
8. Write your code for the new error checking functions following your algorithm and using good usability principles. Incorporate them into your previously working code.
9. Properly comment your code with intro comments, function comments, and line comments
10. Write a set of testcases in testcases.xlsx to test your new functionality (your error checking). Your test cases from Lab 3 should be sufficient for testing in general, so focus on the new ones.



## Submit:
1. To Github:
    1. Your Java file ( a JavaATMWithObjects.java file)
    2. Your algorithm (algorithm.txt)
    3. Your testcases (testCases.txt)
